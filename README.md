Localized Game Terms - CROWD SOURCING

========================================
Project initialized by Bard Hole Standal

========================================

A crowd sourcing effort to get the most common terms in games localized into different languages. 
The basis is a CSV file, currently optimized/formatted for use with NGUI (for Unity 3D).

NOTES ON EDITING:

Editing the CSV requires that you use UTF-8 encoding, so either edit it directly via Github or use a CSV editor that saves in the right format. You can always use GitHub's own editor to do the job.

VERY IMPORTANT!
Using MICROSOFT EXCEL will NOT work, it messes up the language encoding!


====================

NOTES ON USAGE:

Please remember these are generic translations. You should have someone check the translations for you before using it.
