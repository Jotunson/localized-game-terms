Localized Game Terms - CROWD SOURCING

========================================
Project initialized by Bard Hole Standal

========================================

A crowd sourcing effort to get the most common terms in games localized into different languages. 
The basis is a CSV file, currently optimized/formatted for use with NGUI (for Unity 3D).

NOTES ON EDITING:

Editing the CSV requires that you use UTF-8 encoding, so either edit it directly via Github or use a CSV editor that saves in the right format. 

VERY IMPORTANT!
Using MICROSOFT EXCEL will NOT work, it messes up the language encoding!
